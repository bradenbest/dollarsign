# $

For people who are too literal to realize that

    $ command

means 

    enter "command" into a terminal

not 

    enter "$ command" into a terminal

Install with

    $ sudo make install

and it will work either way.

    $ echo hello world
    $ $ echo hello world
    $ $ $ echo hello world
    [ad nauseam]
